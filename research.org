* What is the golang standard tool to translate an openapi 3.0+ spec into golang server code
** Golang Tools for OpenAPI 3.0+ Server Generation

*** Official Go Tools
Unfortunately, there is **no official standard tool** in the Go standard library or official Go toolchain for translating OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications into Go server code.

*** Popular Third-Party Tools

**** oapi-codegen
- **Most widely adopted** community tool for OpenAPI 3.0+ to Go generation
- Generates both client and server code
- Supports Gin, Chi, Gorilla Mux, and other popular Go web frameworks
- Active maintenance and good community support

**** go-swagger
- Primarily focused on OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger 2.0)
- Limited OpenAPI 3.0+ support
- More mature but less suitable for modern OpenAPI specs

**** deepmap/oapi-codegen
- GitHub: https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen
- Generates type-safe Go code from OpenAPI 3.0+ specs
- Supports multiple HTTP router backends
- Can generate both server stubs and client libraries

*** Recommended Approach
Since there's no standard Go tool, **oapi-codegen** is the de facto standard in the Go community for OpenAPI 3.0+ server generation due to:
- Active development and maintenance
- Good documentation
- Wide framework support
- Strong type safety
- Regular updates for OpenAPI spec compliance
